                    Hello, I'm Ming Li, with 2+ years of Front-end coding experience. I love to work with companies and consumers to create websites for them. As I'm still a Junior coder, I'm always looking to collaborate with talented people if I have the chance as working and learning from them can increase my experience in this career and theirs as well.

                    Interested in collaborating with me for internships or work? Here is my <a href="./pages/new-resume.html" target="_blank">resume</a> in which you can find my contact information. Thank you for your time and maybe we'll get some pizza sometime.

                    <p>Amazing effort by Ming, as he gave a genuine interest in the topic given and still took enough creative liberty to surprise me with his "out of the box" design choices. The selection tool he seamlessly implemented was a great user interface choice, and I feel helps the content flow much better as opposed to a standard static text element. The quantity and quality of said content also surprised me, as he managed to take a topic I felt well versed in and manage to teach me a few things. Truly a great commission job done by a hard working developer!</p>

                    <p>Mr. Ming Li has tremendous ability to visualize a given project and produce an end result far exceeding expectations. Every interface is clean, intuitive and easy to navigate for the end user. He also gives all of his projects great thought and all of his projects demonstrate going above and beyond while still retaining accessibility and make sense from a users point of view.  </p>
